### What is this blog about?

 I plan to ramble on about things I find interesting.  PowerShell, technology, and food will be the most common, perhaps in that order.  Many posts will simply be reminders for future reference or my draft notes from work.

### Who are you?

I live in Rochester, New York and spend my days designing and building solutions as a Systems Engineer in a regional health system.  My various pursuits include science, information security, technology, cooking, tennis, and spending time with my wife and family.

### Where did you get the rambling cookie monster handle?

I have a voracious appetite for cookies and other sweets.  A co-worker noticed this and gave me the cookie.monster@ e-mail address.  Another co-worker added the handle to our office name plate.  On a side note, being known as the cookie monster does not help when you want to cut back on cookies.
