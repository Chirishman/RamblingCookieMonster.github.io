Exciting times in the Microsoft world.  PowerShell is turning 5, various components are going open source, and a server without local logon capability is coming.

This change is bringing to light 

I see three major challenges:
* How do you convince management that this is the correct and necessary direction?
* How do you adjust hiring processes to filter out the click-next laggards?
* How do you purge, move, or otherwise deal with the existing laggards?


If you are in the field of IT, I trust that you have read Limoncelli's The Practice of System and Network Administration. He has similar notions:

> ...People that do desktop/laptop system administration and general in-office IT service. However those jobs are turning more and more into the equivalent of working at a mobile phone store: helping people is basic equipment problems and customer support. Those jobs pay less than half what a sysadmin normally gets paid.

> So... do you want to change jobs to one that cuts your salary in half, or lose your job completely when someone that does know how to script replaces you?

How do you convince management that this is the correct and necessary direction?

How do you adjust hiring processes to filter out the click-next laggards?

How do you purge, move, or otherwise deal with the existing laggards?
