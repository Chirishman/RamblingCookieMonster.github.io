### Rambling

A short while back I gave my first live [webinar](https://github.com/RamblingCookieMonster/Git-Presentation), discussing some basics on version control over Git and GitHub. I'm gearing up on similar sessions at work to get folks going with Stash.

When I look at version control as an IT professional, one pain point stood out: in addition to changing workflow and learning version control, folks are now working with config files and similar files in source control. Not where they live. Wouldn't it be handy if we could use version control, and not worry about remembering to be sure to move the files to prod?

This post will discuss a simple potential solution to this: [PSDeploy](https://github.com/RamblingCookieMonster/PSDeploy).

### Continuous Deployment

Developers realized this was important long ago. There are some specialized deployment tools like [Octodeploy](http://octopusdeploy.com/), and continuous integration and deployment tools like [AppVeyor](http://www.appveyor.com/) or [TeamCity](https://www.jetbrains.com/teamcity/), and continuous integration tools like [Jenkins](http://jenkins-ci.org/)) that can be shoehorned into a deployment pipieline.

So, with all these solutions, why duct-tape something together?

* I like fun side projects.  This fit the bill!
* I'm hoping to introduce version control to the team, and a simplified deployment system might help
* We use [Jenkins](https://www.hodgkins.net.au/powershell/automating-with-jenkins-and-powershell-on-windows-part-1/). Their build definition process leaves a bit to be desired. This allows me to use the same abstracted deployment for every project, as long as I have a deployments.yml in the repo root.
* This might help folks who use more than one tool chain. I could use PSDeploy with Jenkins, TeamCity, AppVeyor, etc.

Let's take a look at the first draft of PSDeploy.

### PSDeploy

So! This is a quick and dirty module that simplifies distribution. The basic idea is that you have a configuration yaml file that defines
